This is my collection of $\LaTeX$
tools that has been very useful in practice.

Topics include:   

- [Page setup](#page)
- [Section titles](#sections)
- [Write latex functions](#latex_fun)  
- [Play with References](#refs) 
- [Figures](#figs)
- [Others](#others)

## Manipulating length

### default lengths in LaTeX

- `\linewidth` : width of the line in the local environment
- `\textwidth, \textheight` : width/height of text on the page
- `\baselineskip`: normal distance between lines 
- `\smallskip, \medskip, \bigskip`: insert small/medium/big vertical space
- `x \hspace{\stretch{1}} x \hspace{\stretch{3}}`: distance ratio between x's is 1:3

### define/renew distances

- `\setlength{\mylength}{length_value}` : create new length `\mylength`
- `\addtolength{\mylength}{value}`: change existing length

## <a name="page"></a> About page setup
`geometry`

## <a name="sections"></a> Adjust section titles
You can use package `titlesec` to customize sections and chapter. Say if you want to change the presentation of `\subsection{}`, you can use the following template:

```latex
\titleformat{<command>}
[<shape>]  {<format>}  {<label>} {<sep>}
{<before-code>}
[<after-code>]
```

where 

- `<command>` is the command to be changed   
- `<shape>` : different themes for sectioning  
- `<format>`: set typeface font and etc  
- `<sep>`:horizontal separtion  
- `<before-code>,<after-code>`: code to be inserted before and after section title

Eg: 

```latex
\titleformat
{\subsection}  % which command to renew
[runin] %shape: with bottom ruling
{\Large\itshape} % font
{}{0.5ex} %sep
{
    \rule{\textwidth}{1pt}
    \centering
} % before-code
[
\rule{\textwidth}{0.3pt}
] % after-code
```

Just to change spacing, can use:   
`\titlespacing{<command>}{<left>}{<before-sep>}{<after-sep>}`

Some useful variables:

- `\thechapter`
- `\thesection, \thesubsection`

## <a name="figs"></a>Figures

### Figures side by side

You can use the `subcaption` package and `subfigure` environment for this feature. It allows you to label and caption each subfigure as well.

The following is a example of inserting two figures side by side:

```latex
\begin{figure}
\centering
\begin{subfigure}{.5\textwidth}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=.4\linewidth]{image1}
  \caption{A subfigure}
  \label{fig:sub1}
\end{subfigure}%
\begin{subfigure}{.5\textwidth}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=.4\linewidth]{image1}
  \caption{A subfigure}
  \label{fig:sub2}
\end{subfigure}
\caption{A figure with two subfigures}
\label{fig:test}
\end{figure}
```

Example from [stackoverflow discussion](http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/37581/latex-figures-side-by-side).


## <a name="refs"></a>About References
Many of the functions I'm going to introduce are based on package `natbib`, so just `\usepackage{natbib}`. Manual for this package could be found here at: [natbib manual](http://ctan.mackichan.com/macros/latex/contrib/natbib/natnotes.pdf). 

Now for the following questions:

- How to include references?   
	Of course you can make a list of it everytime you write something. But that's just inefficient. I would recommend keeping a reference "database" in a `.bib` file, and then refer to it everytime you write.   
	Here's how to inlude the `.bib` file in you `.tex` file:   
  `\bibliography{your/secret/path/to/file.bib}`

- How to choose different presentation of references?   
There are mainly two ways to present references in `natbib` package:
	- `\citet{}` : for textual citation (eg. `PowerGod et al, 2016` )
	- `\citep{}` : for parenthetical citation 


- Package options for `natbib`:    
`$\usepackage[option1,option2, ... ]{natbib} `
	- `sort&compress` : compress consecutive citations into `cite1 - citeN`


More examples could be found in `natbib manual`.

- Different journal may require different bibliography styles.   
To preview their different appearances, check out [bib style](http://www.reed.edu/cis/help/LaTeX/bibtexstyles.html) or [bib style2](http://www.cs.stir.ac.uk/~kjt/software/latex/showbst.html).


## <a name="latex_fun"></a> Write your own latex functions


Briefly introduce how to write a new function in $\LaTeX$. Let me illustrate with an example function with 2 variables:

```latex
\newcommand{\myfun}[2] { #1 #2 \ is \ awesome! }
% [2]: function of 2 variables
% #1 #2: input parameters of the function

% To use the function, inputs should be passed with separate brackets {}
\myfun{Power}{God}
```

And see what we get:   
$\newcommand{\myfun}[2] { #1 #2 \ is \ awesome! }$
$\myfun{Power}{God}$




## <a name="others"></a> Others
### Comment out a section of $\LaTeX$ code
Two ways you can do this:

- Use the `verbatim` package:

```latex
\usepackage{verbatim}   
\begin{comment}
Junk lines1
Junk lines2
\end{comment}
```

- The second way is much easier

```latex
\iffalse
Junk line1
Junk line2
\fi
```
  And it allow comments to be activated by replacing `\iffalse` with `\iftrue`.

### Add hyperlinks
You will need to load package `hyperref` to do this. The symtax is the following:	
`\href{ link url }{ Your description to the link }`   
which will only shows `Your description ...`. or:   
`\url{www.yale.edu}`   
which shows the full link.

### Change local linespacing
Change the linespacing for only part of the text.    
Need to load package `setspace`. And use `setstrech` function in the following way:

```latex
{ \setstretch{1.5}  % linespace multiplied by 1.5
	Context where local linespacing is \\
	to be applied.\\
	% remember to leave an empty row here
}
```

### Control column width of table

For example, I want to control my second column to have a specified width (eg. 7cm). I'll use the following commands:

```latex
\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l p{7cm}}
  \hline
Variables  & Description \\ 
my_variable & This is a variable with very long description, 
            and requires 2 rows in the table.
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
```

where $p$ stands for 'paragraph column with text vertically aligned at the top'. We can replace $p$ with $m$ or $b$ for middle/bottom, but package `array` is required.
