###FAcebook C3D Using Tutorial

C3D is a deep learning tool which is modified version of BVLC caffe to support 3D convolution and pooling. it was released by Facebook. In the field of human action recognition, C3D feature of video clip is the state-of-the-art feature. In this blog, I write some notes for using this tool in practice.

#### Train 3D Convnet from scratch
Train from scratch C3D offers some useful shell scripts to simplify our job, we can read the scripts and adapt it according our tasks.
NOTE: you must adapt the shell scripts to ensure that every parameter is correct for your task!
the schedule of training from scratch is(assuming we are training on ucf101):

1. **Compute Volume mean for your data:** My input data is in mat. So, first we need to compute lmdb
``` bash
# modify examples/c3d_train_ucf101
GLOG_logtostderr=1 ../../build/tools/compute_volume_mean_from_list.bin ../c3d_finetuning/train_01.lst 16 128 171 1 ucf101_train_mean.binaryproto 10


```  
####Debug caffe

```  bash 
gdb --args ../../install/tools/caffe train --solver=testNet_solver.prototxt

#assume you are at C3D root directory right now
1. cd examples/c3d_train_ucf101 
2. sh create_volume_means.sh # compute the mean file of your dataset
3. sh train_ucf101.sh # train from scratch 
4. test_ucf101.sh # test the accuracy of training

```  
To DO
1. compute_volume_mean_from_list.sh-->compute_volume_mean_from_list.cpp --> has import imageio --> modify for CT (UNderstand Datum)
