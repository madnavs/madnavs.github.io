<h4 id="making-cse-231-cnn-separable">Making CSE-231 CNN Separable</h4>

<p><strong>Reading</strong>:
- <a href="http://cthorey.github.io./backpropagation/" target="_blank">gradient flowing through batch normalization</a>
- <a href="http://cthorey.github.io./backprop_conv/" target="_blank">Explaining implementation convolutional neural networks</a>
Todo:
1. implement separable code and visualize filters and compute reconstruction error
2. plot time difference in implementations</p>

<p><strong>L1 and L2 distance</strong>: Pairwise absolute difference
$$ d_1(I_1,I_2)=\Sigma _p|I_1^p-I_2^p |$$
$$d_2(I_1,I_2)=\Sigma_p(I_1^p−I_2^p)^2$$</p>

<p>L1 vs. L2. It is interesting to consider differences between the two metrics. In particular, the L2 distance is much more unforgiving than the L1 distance when it comes to differences between two vectors. That is, the L2 distance prefers many medium disagreements to one big one. L1 and L2 distances (or equivalently the L1/L2 norms of the differences between a pair of images) are the most commonly used special cases of a p-norm.</p>

<p>we wish to encode some preference for a certain set of weights W over others to remove this ambiguity. We can do so by extending the loss function with a regularization penalty R(W). The most common regularization penalty is the L2 norm that discourages large weights through an elementwise quadratic penalty over all parameters:
$$R(W) = \sum_k\sum<em>l W</em>{k,l}^2$$
In the expression above, we are summing up all the squared elements of W. Notice that the regularization function is not a function of the data, it is only based on the weights.
The <strong>Softmax classifier</strong> uses the cross-entropy loss.
<strong>Intutive Backpropagation</strong>
Every node can compute 2 things 1. its output value and 2. the local gradient of its inputs with respect to its output value.</p>

<pre><code class="language-python"># set some inputs
x = -2; y = 5; z = -4

# perform the forward pass
q = x + y # q becomes 3
f = q * z # f becomes -12

# perform the backward pass (backpropagation) in reverse order:
# first backprop through f = q * z
dfdz = q # df/dz = q, so gradient on z becomes 3
dfdq = z # df/dq = z, so gradient on q becomes -4
# now backprop through q = x + y
dfdx = 1.0 * dfdq # dq/dx = 1. And the multiplication here is the chain rule!
dfdy = 1.0 * dfdq # dq/dy = 1
</code></pre>

<p>Notice that backpropagation is a beautifully local process. Every gate in a circuit diagram gets some inputs and can right away compute two things: 1. its output value and 2. the local gradient of its inputs with respect to its output value. Notice that the gates can do this completely independently without being aware of any of the details of the full circuit that they are embedded in. However, once the forward pass is over, during backpropagation the gate will eventually learn about the gradient of its output value on the final output of the entire circuit. Chain rule says that the gate should take that gradient and multiply it into every gradient it normally computes for all of its inputs.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This extra multiplication (for each input) due to the chain rule can turn a single and relatively useless gate into a cog in a complex circuit such as an entire neural network.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lets get an intuition for how this works by referring again to the example. The add gate received inputs [-2, 5] and computed output 3. Since the gate is computing the addition operation, its local gradient for both of its inputs is +1. The rest of the circuit computed the final value, which is -12. During the backward pass in which the chain rule is applied recursively backwards through the circuit, the add gate (which is an input to the multiply gate) learns that the gradient for its output was -4. If we anthropomorphize the circuit as wanting to output a higher value (which can help with intuition), then we can think of the circuit as “wanting” the output of the add gate to be lower (due to negative sign), and with a force of 4. To continue the recurrence and to chain the gradient, the add gate takes that gradient and multiplies it to all of the local gradients for its inputs (making the gradient on both x and y 1 * -4 = -4). Notice that this has the desired effect: If x,y were to decrease (responding to their negative gradient) then the add gate’s output would decrease, which in turn makes the multiply gate’s output increase.</p>

<p>Backpropagation can thus be thought of as gates communicating to each other (through the gradient signal) whether they want their outputs to increase or decrease (and how strongly), so as to make the final output value higher.</p>

<p>L2 regularization is perhaps the most common form of regularization. It can be implemented by penalizing the squared magnitude of all parameters directly in the objective. That is, for every weight ww in the network, we add the term 12λw212λw2 to the objective, where λλ is the regularization strength. It is common to see the factor of 1212 in front because then the gradient of this term with respect to the parameter ww is simply λwλw instead of 2λw2λw. The L2 regularization has the intuitive interpretation of heavily penalizing peaky weight vectors and preferring diffuse weight vectors. As we discussed in the Linear Classification section, due to multiplicative interactions between weights and inputs this has the appealing property of encouraging the network to use all of its inputs a little rather that some of its inputs a lot. Lastly, notice that during gradient descent parameter update, using the L2 regularization ultimately means that every weight is decayed linearly: W += -lambda * W towards zero.</p>

<p>L1 regularization is another relatively common form of regularization, where for each weight ww we add the term λ∣w∣λ∣w∣ to the objective. It is possible to combine the L1 regularization with the L2 regularization: λ1∣w∣+λ2w2λ1∣w∣+λ2w2 (this is called Elastic net regularization). The L1 regularization has the intriguing property that it leads the weight vectors to become sparse during optimization (i.e. very close to exactly zero). In other words, neurons with L1 regularization end up using only a sparse subset of their most important inputs and become nearly invariant to the “noisy” inputs. In comparison, final weight vectors from L2 regularization are usually diffuse, small numbers. In practice, if you are not concerned with explicit feature selection, L2 regularization can be expected to give superior performance over L1.</p>

<p><strong>Rough</strong>
1. model.param contains w&rsquo;s and b&rsquo;s.</p>

<pre><code>- x: Input data of shape (N, C, H, W)
- w: Filter weights of shape (F, C, HH, WW)
- b: Biases, of shape (F,)
- - conv_param: A dictionary with the following keys:
  - 'stride': The number of pixels between adjacent receptive fields in the
    horizontal and vertical directions.
  - 'pad': The number of pixels that will be used to zero-pad the input.

Returns a tuple of:
- out: Output data, of shape (N, F, H', W') where H' and W' are given by
  H' = 1 + (H + 2 * pad - HH) / stride
  W' = 1 + (W + 2 * pad - WW) / stride
- cache: (x, w, b, conv_param)
</code></pre>

<p>####Two Things
1. <strong>Tensor decomposition</strong>: Given a learned filter $F$
$$min_{a^k,b^k,w^k}$$</p>
